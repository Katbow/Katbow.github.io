Hello!

I've been working as a Software Engineer and now Software Consultant in London
for the past 2 years.

I've built apps for NHS trusts, helped [Felcana](https://felcana.com/)
flesh out their development processes, and have most recently been working with
[Casper](https://casper.com/).

If you want to get in touch, [drop me a message](contact)!
